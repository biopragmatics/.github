The Biopragmatics Stack is a set of interconnected software components and curated data artifacts that
support standardizing and processing biomedical data and knowledge.

## PURLs

The Biopragmatics Stack uses https://w3id.org to create persistent uniform resource locators (PURLs)
for various rsources. These are configured on GitHub in the `.htaccess` file in
https://github.com/perma-id/w3id.org/tree/master/biopragmatics.
